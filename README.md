Sanscript
=========
Sanscript is a transliteration library for Indian languages. It supports the most popular Indian scripts and several different romanization schemes. Although Sanscript focuses on Sanskrit transliteration, it has partial support for other languages and is easy to extend.

This is a meta repository for various implementations of Sanscript. If you've written an implementation of Sanscript in some other language, [create an issue for it](https://github.com/sanskrit/sanscript/issues) so that we can add it here. Where possible, please use [the JavaScript version](https://github.com/sanskrit/sanscript.js) as a starting point.
